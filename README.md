# Trading Bot Example

This is a Trading Bot smart contract that utilizes flashloans to execute arbitrage transactions between exchanges. 

When there is high volatility and high trading volumes within the crypto markets, it creates opportunities for arbitrage as price updates can lag between exchanges. 

This trading bot takes advantage of these price discrepancies when they exist, by borrowing funds from a flashloan provider (DyDx), executing an abitrage trade, and paying back the loan within the same transaction.
